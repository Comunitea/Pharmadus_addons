### Sale Transfer Reports

The module adds Pharma-specific fields to:
- Sales Orders Report: Shows product line/subline
- Purchase Order Report: Shows purchase line/subline
- Invoice Reports: Full specifications included

### Custom Fields on Product Template

Additional fields per Odoo configuration:
- `Cantidad`: Standard quantity value
- Element quantities per outer/display/full box
- Product lineage reference (line → subline)
- Purchase catalog references
- Classification data (packaging, base form, garment, grouping)

## User Groups & Permissions

| Role | Access Level | Model Restrictions |
|------|--------------|-------------------|
| Users (base)* | Read-only specs | Cannot create/delete specs |
| Manager | Full CRUD on catalog and transfers | All models editable |

\* Applies to non-product managers for specification views. Transfer documents accessible by all users with base permissions.

## Best Practices

1. **Multi-Company Setup**: Use `company_id` field to separate data per organization. Empty = global spec.
2. **Validation Rules**: All quantities must be ≥1. Company consistency enforced on sublines.
3. **Documentation**: Maintain clean names for easy search and reporting.
4. **Sequencing**: Adjust sequence numbers when reordering catalog lists.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Error al crear línea"**
- Ensure line name is unique or check existing records with same name (case-sensitive)

**"La sublínea debe pertenecer a la misma compañía que su línea"**
- Create subline under parent line of same company, OR create subline without specifying company

**"No se encontró el movimiento de origen"**
- Ensure wizard opened from active picking with stock moves in current operation

### Debug Mode Tips
Enable developer mode (Settings → Settings) to see field states and model hierarchies more clearly.

## Reporting

All custom fields available on:
- Sales Analytics Reports
- Purchase Analytics  
- Invoice Margin Analysis
- Stock Valuation Layer Analysis

Use search views to filter/specify grouping by line or subline ID for reporting purposes.
